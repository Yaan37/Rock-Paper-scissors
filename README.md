Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
🎮 Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game! 🎉

This is a simple interactive console game where you can play against the computer. It uses the classic rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and includes fun emojis to enhance the user experience.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Play
Start the game by running the Python script rock_paper_scissors.py.

The game will prompt you to choose one of the following options:

🪨 Rock
📃 Paper
✂️ Scissors
Input your choice by typing rock, paper, or scissors.

The computer will randomly select its choice, and the game will compare the two.

## Results:

🎲 If both you and the computer choose the same item, it's a tie.
🎉 If your choice beats the computer’s (e.g., rock beats scissors), you win!

After each round, you can choose whether to play again by typing Y for yes or N for no.
